Here is a collection of homework/projects for COMP.2040/Computing IV. See final portfolio for breakdown, sample code, and output of each assignment.

Quick Summary -
PS0 - Hello World with SFML
  Introductory assignment using C++ and SFML library to create unique features with image sprites.

PS1a/PS1b - Linear Feedback Shift Register
  Two part assignment that had use simulate an LFSR and encrypt digital pictures. This assignment also introduced error checking with the BOOST Test Framework.
  
PS2A/PS2B - N-Body Simulation
  Two part assignment that had us simulate the motions of celestial bodies in orbit in an static universe.
  
PS3 - DNA Sequence Alignment
  This assignment had us solve a fundamental problem in computational biology and learn about dynamic programming paradigms. Given two random gene sequences, we
  needed to compare each character and determine if they match, mismatch, or have a gap (meaning no character exist to match). Each of these characteristics 
  have a numerical cost and we needed to find the lowest total cost and traversal.

PS4A/PS4B - Synthesizing a Plucked String Sound
  Two part assignment had us simulate plucking a guitar string using SFML sound library, Karplus-Strong algorithm, and a CircularBuffer API. This assignment 
  also introduced Cpplint style guidelines and unit testing.
 
PS5 - Recusrive Graphics (Triangle Fractal) ***Unfinished

PS6 - Kronos/Intro to Regular Expression
  Final assignment that had us analyze a Linux clock device called InTouch. InTouch stored information of its own status and we needed to generate regular
  expressions to parse through the file. The goal was to create log files that help distinguish if the device failed to boot up or not using the Boost regex
  library.
