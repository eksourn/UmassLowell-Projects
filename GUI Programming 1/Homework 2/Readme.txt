For this assignment we were asked to recreate a website based on a series of images with some helpful hints. The hardest thing about this assignment for a   
beginner in CSS and html was correctly positioning the divs with floats, text-aligns, etc so that when the page minimizes it would achieve the same look as  
the screenshots.
