Homework 4: Using the jQuery Plugin/UI w/ Your Dynamic Table 

Github URLs Part 1: https://eksourn.github.io/HW3/mult-table.html  
  
This assignment had us expand on homework 3. Here we had to implement jQuery validation plugin, sliders, and widgets into the dynamic table. Some of the things  
we had to test for included invalid characters being submitted, empty form fields, and out of range values each with their own detailed error message (that  
couldn't be alerts). There were sliders for each of the submission fields that when manipulated dynamically updated the table on screen.
