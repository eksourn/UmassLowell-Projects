This assignment had us expand on homework 3. Here we had to implement jQuery validation plugin, sliders, and widgets into the dynamic table. Some of the things  
we had to test for included invalid characters being submitted, empty form fields, and out of range values each with their own detailed error message (that  
couldn't be alerts). There were sliders for each of the submission fields that when manipulated dynamically updated the table on screen. For the widget we had  
to essentially save a snapshot of outputted table in a separate "tabs".  
At the moment there are some issues such as not being able to delete the tabs individually or all together, alongside some issues that I had before in the   
previous iteration where the top table header repeated itself.
