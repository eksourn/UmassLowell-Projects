Homework 3: Creating an Interactive Dynamic Table

As of this moment the assignment is nearly complete. There are some minor bugs with table headers not showing up and some values not being displayed.
  
For this assignment we were asked to create a table that would dynamically update itself whenever new values are given w/o refreshing the page.
