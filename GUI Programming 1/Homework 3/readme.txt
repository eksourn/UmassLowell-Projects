Homework 3: Creating an Interactive Dynamic Table

As of this moment the assignment is nearly complete. There are some minor bugs with table headers not showing up, some values not being displayed and  
table headers being repeated.
  
For this assignment we were asked to create a table that would dynamically update itself whenever new values are given w/o refreshing the page. This was my  
first time working with Javascript and so there are some bugs.
