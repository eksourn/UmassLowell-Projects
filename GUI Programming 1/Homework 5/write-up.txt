GUI Programming 1
Homework 5

At the moment the program is not fully implemented and doesn't work. What's implemented is simply the barebones html layout, the three images for the one-line scrabble w/o 
any of its features, and not working code for the draggable feature. 

As the semester neared the end I found less and less time to work on the projects and this being my last assignment for my last course I decided that turning it in as it was 
better than the stressful crunchtime.
